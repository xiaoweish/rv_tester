Performance Monitoring (pmu)
============================

Performance Monitoring Unit infrastructure that samples the RISC-V DUT's hardware performance
counters (PMCs), aggregates them on the C++ side, and reports per-hart and shared-cache (SC)
metrics, optionally checking them against expected values.

What it does
------------

The DUT exposes per-cycle event activity over the PMC interface (PMCI). ``pmu.sv`` accumulates each
event into wide counters and emits a transaction whenever a sync point is hit (terminate, overflow,
periodic cycle/instruction sync, ``perf_start`` / ``perf_end`` markers, or an ``mhpmevent`` CSR
write). The C++ ``pmu`` class receives those transactions, folds the (truncated,
``pmcounter_dpi_width``-bit) deltas back into full 64-bit counters, logs metrics, and runs optional
pass/fail checks (IPC, L1D read-miss rate, and sideband-vs-hpmcounter cross-checks).

                                                                                                   report + checks (IPC,
                                                                                                   L1D miss, sideband PMC)

The PMU is gated by the topology ``PMCI`` attributes: ``PMU_ENABLE`` instantiates the module and
``SC_PMCI_ENABLED`` enables the shared-cache path. The event set is data-driven — events are
defined in the ``*_pmc_spec.csv`` specs and generated into the C++/SV sources at build time.

Setup
-----

Enable the topology attributes (``rv_tester_pmci_attrs`` in the ``*_rv_tester_hart.yml``):

.. code-block:: yaml

   rv_tester_pmci_attrs: &rv_tester_pmci_attrs
     PMU_ENABLE: 1
     SC_PMCI_ENABLED: 1

At build time ``pmu_gen.py`` consumes the ``*_pmc_spec.csv`` specs and generates the matching C++
enums/maps and SV fragments — to add an event, edit the CSV only.

Then run with ``+perf`` to collect metrics. Optional plusargs:

.. code-block:: text

   +perf                                   # master enable (required)
   +pmcounters_log                         # dump per-trigger counter rows to log
   +sync_pmcounters_period=<N>             # periodic sync every N cycles (0 = only at terminate)
   +ipc_check +ipc_expected=<f>            # pass/fail IPC check within +ipc_tolerance_perc
   +l1d_read_miss_check ...                # pass/fail L1D read-miss-rate check
   +pmc_sideband_check                     # cross-check hpmcounters vs sideband counters
