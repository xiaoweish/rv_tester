**RV_TESTER** is a RISC-V CPU testing component written in SystemVerilog and C++.

It provides the verification collateral needed to interface with a RISC-V CPU core and
perform lockstep architectural checks against the `Whisper <https://github.com/tenstorrent/whisper>`_
RISC-V instruction set simulator (ISS). Along with the co-simulation flow, it provides soft
device models, an AXI transactor/master, performance-counter (PMU) modeling, interrupt and
trigger generation, and the platform glue that ties it all together. RV_TESTER is
RVA23-compatible.

The DUT (the RISC-V core under test) is surrounded with everything needed to boot, stimulate,
observe, and check the core. As the core executes, its retired instructions and memory-ordering
events are checked instruction-by-instruction against Whisper, while its bus traffic is serviced
by a software system model of the surrounding platform.
